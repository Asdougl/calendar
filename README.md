# asdougl/calendar

This is my personal calendar app that I actively use, you can try it out at [calendar.asdougl.com](https://asdougl.calendar.com/).

This is actively in development so honestly at this point if you're going to use it full time let me know and I'll take better care of not completely re-designing the app every few months.

Please raise an issues, bugs or suggestions as Issues and I'll try to address them ASAP.
